                <p>
                    The Mandaya are renowned throughout the Philippines for their exceptional weaving skills and 
                    vibrant traditional clothing. Their name comes from "man" (first) and "daya" (upstream), 
                    signifying their identity as upland dwellers. The Mandaya have preserved intricate textile 
                    arts that tell stories of their history, beliefs, and connection to the natural world.

                <h2>The Art of Dagmay Weaving</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mandaya are most famous for creating dagmay cloth, an intricate textile featuring geometric 
                    patterns woven with abaca fiber. Each pattern carries symbolic meaning, representing elements 
                    of nature, spiritual beliefs, and tribal history. The weaving process is labor-intensive, 
                    requiring months to complete a single piece of high-quality cloth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional Mandaya clothing is adorned with elaborate embroidery and beadwork. Women's blouses 
                    feature intricate designs on the sleeves and chest, while men's garments display bold geometric 
                    patterns. The colors—red, black, and white—hold cultural significance, with each hue representing 
                    different aspects of Mandaya cosmology.

                <p>
                    The Mandaya face challenges in preserving their weaving traditions as younger generations pursue 
                    modern careers. However, cultural advocates work to revitalize interest in traditional textiles 
                    through workshops, competitions, and market opportunities. Mandaya weavers are gaining recognition 
                    nationally and internationally, helping ensure this ancient art form survives for future generations.
