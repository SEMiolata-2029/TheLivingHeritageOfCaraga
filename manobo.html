                <p>
                    The Manobo are one of the largest and most widespread indigenous groups in Mindanao. Their name 
                    derives from the word meaning "people" or "person" in their language. Known for their rich oral 
                    traditions and deep spiritual connection to the land, the Manobo have maintained their cultural 
                    identity for centuries.

                    <p><strong>Language:</strong> Manobo languages (multiple dialects including Agusan Manobo, Dibabawon, and Ata Manobo)</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 100,000 across different Manobo subgroups</p>

                <p>
                    The Manobo people practice sustainable agriculture, cultivating rice, corn, sweet potatoes, and 
                    various root crops. They employ traditional swidden farming (kaingin), which involves clearing 
                    small forest areas, cultivating them for several seasons, then allowing the land to regenerate. 
                    This method has sustained their communities for generations while preserving forest ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manobo villages are typically built near rivers and streams, with houses elevated on stilts to 
                    protect against flooding and wild animals. Their traditional homes are constructed from bamboo, 
                    wood, and cogon grass, materials that maintain cool interiors in the tropical climate.
