                <h2>About the Higaonon</h2>
                <p>
                    The name "Higaonon" literally means "people of the living mountains" or "people from the mountains." 
                    This tribe inhabits the highland areas of Agusan del Sur and maintains strong cultural traditions 
                    centered around respect for nature and community harmony. The Higaonon are known for their 
                    sophisticated tribal governance systems and elaborate ceremonial practices.

                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Highland areas of Agusan del Sur and adjacent mountain ranges</p>
                    <p><strong>Language:</strong> Higaonon language (related to Binukid)</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 30,000-50,000</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary Livelihood:</strong> Swidden agriculture, coffee cultivation, and handicraft production</p>

                <h2>Governance and Social Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    The Higaonon maintain a strong Datu system, where hereditary leaders guide community decisions 
                    and resolve conflicts. The Datu is not merely a political leader but also a spiritual and cultural 
                    authority who upholds customary laws (likay) passed down through generations. Community decisions 
                    are made through consensus during tribal assemblies called "hubon."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their traditional justice system emphasizes restorative rather than punitive measures, focusing 
                    on healing relationships and maintaining social harmony. Disputes are settled through mediation, 
                    with penalties often involving ritual offerings and community service rather than imprisonment.
                </p>

                <h2>Preserving Highland Heritage</h2>
                <p>
                    The Higaonon actively work to preserve their cultural heritage through tribal schools that teach 
                    traditional language, customs, and values alongside modern education. Their strong governance 
                    structures and commitment to customary laws help maintain cultural continuity even as external 
                    pressures increase. The tribe also advocates for ancestral domain protection and sustainable 
                    highland resource management.
