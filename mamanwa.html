                <p>
                    The Mamanwa are considered one of the oldest indigenous groups in the Philippines, often referred 
                    to as the "original people" of Mindanao. Anthropologists believe they are among the earliest 
                    inhabitants of the archipelago, with their ancestors arriving thousands of years ago. The Mamanwa 
                    have maintained a semi-nomadic lifestyle, moving through the forests with seasonal patterns.

                    <p><strong>Language:</strong> Mamanwa language (Austronesian language family)</p>
                    <p><strong>Population:</strong> Estimated 5,000-10,000 individuals</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary Livelihood:</strong> Hunting, gathering, and limited agriculture</p>

                <h2>Traditional Lifestyle</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mamanwa are expert foragers and hunters, possessing deep knowledge of forest ecosystems. 
                    They identify hundreds of edible plants, medicinal herbs, and useful materials within their 
                    territory. Their traditional diet consists of wild game, freshwater fish, forest fruits, honey, 
                    and edible roots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike agriculturalist tribes, the Mamanwa historically moved their settlements seasonally, 
                    following game migration patterns and fruiting seasons. Their temporary shelters were simple 
                    lean-tos constructed from forest materials, easily dismantled when moving to new locations.

                <h2>Challenges and Resilience</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mamanwa face significant challenges as their ancestral forests diminish due to logging and 
                    agricultural expansion. Many Mamanwa communities have been forced to adopt more sedentary lifestyles, 
                    leading to cultural changes. Despite these challenges, they work to preserve their language, 
                    traditional knowledge, and cultural practices while advocating for their ancestral domain rights.
